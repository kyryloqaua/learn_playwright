## Example: Automating Login on "https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login"

To demonstrate the capabilities of Playwright, let's automate the login process on the website "https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login". We'll use Playwright to navigate to the login page, enter credentials, and submit the login form.

### Steps:

1. **Installation**: Begin by installing Playwright in your project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install playwright
    ```

2. **Writing Your Script**: Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `loginTest.js`) and write your Playwright script. Here's an example script to automate the login process:

    ```javascript
    const { chromium } = require('playwright');

    (async () => {
      const browser = await chromium.launch();
      const context = await browser.newContext();
      const page = await context.newPage();

      await page.goto('https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login');

      await page.fill('#username', 'your_username');
      await page.fill('#password', 'your_password');

      await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

      await browser.close();
    })();
    ```

    Replace `'your_username'` and `'your_password'` with your actual credentials.

3. **Execution**: Run your script using Node.js. Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    node loginTest.js
    ```

    This command will execute your Playwright script, automating the login process on the specified website.
